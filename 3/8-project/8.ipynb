Again, this is rarely what you want to do! Contrary to **TRUNCATE TABLE**, doing a **DELETE** without a **WHERE** won't allow you to restart the sequence if you have one in your table. More importantly, in a future lesson we'll learn about indexing as a way to make queries perform faster in the presence of large amounts of data. Running TRUNCATE will also clear these indexes, which will further accelerate queries once new data gets inserted in that table."

    "| **INSERT ... VALUES** | One form of adding data into a table; used when introducing new data in a table. This data would come from an external source like an application. |\n",
    "| **INSERT ... SELECT** | One form of adding data into a table; used when taking already existing data from a table and migrating it — most often with some modifications or clean-ups — into an already existing table. |\n",
    "| **UPDATE**           | Used to update rows of data within a given column with new values. |\n",
    "| **DELETE**           | Used to delete some portion of data from a table. |\n",
    "| **BEGIN**            | Starts a transaction. |\n",
    "| **COMMIT**           | Tells the system to attempt to complete the transaction (make the requested changes). Similar functionality is also achieved with END. |\n",
    "| **ROLLBACK**         | Tells the system to not commit any changes as part of the current transaction, discarding the changes. |\n",
    "| **ACID**             | An acronym that describes the transactional guarantees provided by a relational database. |\n",
    "| **Atomicity**        | The database guarantees that a transaction will either register all the commands in a transaction, or none of them. |\n",
    "| **Consistency**      | The database guarantees that a successful transaction will leave the data in a consistent state, one that obeys all the rules that you've set up. |\n",
    "| **Isolation**        | The database guarantees that concurrent transactions don't \"see each other\" until they are committed. Committing a transaction is a command that tells the database to execute all the commands we passed to it since we started that transaction. |\n",
    "| **Durability**       | The database guarantees that once it accepts a transaction and returns a success, the changes introduced by the transaction will be permanently stored on disk, even if the database crashes right after the success response. |\n"
